  abstract={Amodal perception, the ability to comprehend complete object structures from partial visibility, is a fundamental skill, even for infants. 
  Its significance extends to applications like autonomous driving, where a clear understanding of heavily occluded objects is essential. 
  However, modern detection and tracking algorithms often overlook this critical capability, perhaps due to the prevalence of modal annotations in most datasets. 
  To address the scarcity of amodal data, we introduce the TAO-Amodal benchmark, featuring 880 diverse categories in thousands of video sequences. 
  Our dataset includes amodal and modal bounding boxes for visible and occluded objects, including objects that are partially out-of-frame. 
  To enhance amodal tracking with object permanence, we leverage a lightweight plug-in module, the amodal expander, to transform standard, modal 
  trackers into amodal ones through fine-tuning on a few hundred video sequences with data augmentation. We achieve a 3.3% and 1.6% improvement on 
  the detection and tracking of occluded objects on TAO-Amodal. When evaluated on people, our method produces dramatic improvements of 2x compared 
  to state-of-the-art modal baselines.},

  abstract={While self-supervised learning has been shown to benefit a number of vision tasks, existing techniques mainly focus on image-level manipulation, which may not generalize well to downstream tasks at patch or pixel levels. Moreover, 
    existing SSL methods might not sufficiently describe and associate the above representations within and across image scales. 
    In this paper, we propose a Self-Supervised Pyramid Representation Learning (SS-PRL) framework. The
    proposed SS-PRL is designed to derive pyramid representations at patch levels via learning proper prototypes, with
    additional learners to observe and relate inherent semantic information within an image. In particular, we present
    a cross-scale patch-level correlation learning in SS-PRL,
    which allows the model to aggregate and associate information learned across patch scales. We show that, with
    our proposed SS-PRL for model pre-training, one can easily adapt and fine-tune the models for a variety of applications including multi-label classification, object detection,
    and instance segmentation.},

  abstract={Most existing studies improve the efficiency of Split learning
            (SL) by compressing the transmitted features. However, most
            works focus on dimension-wise compression that transforms
            high-dimensional features into a low-dimensional space. In
            this paper, we propose circular convolution-based batch-wise
            compression for SL (C3-SL) to compress multiple features
            into one single feature. To avoid information loss while merging multiple features, we exploit the quasi-orthogonality of
            features in high-dimensional space with circular convolution
            and superposition. To the best of our knowledge, we are
            the first to explore the potential of batch-wise compression
            under the SL scenario. Based on the simulation results on
            CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our method achieves a 16x compression ratio with negligible accuracy drops compared with
            the vanilla SL. Moreover, C3-SL significantly reduces 1152x
            memory and 2.25x computation overhead compared to the
            state-of-the-art dimension-wise compression method.},

  abstract={Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving learning framework, which collaboratively learns a centralized model across edge devices. 
            Each device trains an independent model with its local dataset and only uploads model parameters to mitigate privacy concerns. However, 
            most FL works focus on deep neural networks (DNNs), whose intensive computation hinders FL from practical realization on resource-limited edge devices. 
            In this paper, we exploit the high energy efficiency properties of hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to propose a federated learning HDC (FL-HDC). In FL-HDC, 
            we bipolarize model parameters to significantly reduce communication costs, which is a primary concern in FL. Moreover, we propose a retraining mechanism with 
            adaptive learning rates to compensate for the accuracy degradation caused by bipolarization. Under the FL scenario, our simulation results show the effectiveness
             of our proposed FL-HDC across two datasets, MNIST and ISOLET. Compared with the previous work that transmits complete model parameters to the cloud, FL-HDC greatly
              reduces 23x and 9x communication costs with comparable accuracy in ISOLET and MNIST, respectively.},
