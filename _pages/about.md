I am an incoming research scientist at Bytedance studying multi-modal large language agents. I obtained my master degree in computer vision at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by Prof. [Deva Ramanan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/). My research experience lies in the fields of machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV), including topics like [self-supervised learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Hsieh_Self-Supervised_Pyramid_Representation_Learning_for_Multi-Label_Visual_Analysis_and_Beyond_WACV_2023_paper.pdf), [object tracking](https://tao-amodal.github.io), and vision-language models. 
More specifically, my research pursuits are centered around the development of algorithms that enhance perceptual capabilities under challenging conditions, such as occlusion, leveraging minimal supervision and multimodal information. 

Prior to my master journey, I received my B.S. from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I had the pleasure to work on self-supervised representation learning with Prof. [Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html) and [federated learning](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/Publications/Conference/(2021)%20FL-HDC_Hyperdimensional_Computing_Design_for_the_Application_of_Federated_Learning.pdf) with Prof. [An-Yeu (Andy) Wu](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/).
