I am a research scientist at ByteDance Research, based in San Jose. 

My research covers machine learning and computer vision. My current research focuses on advancing AI for scientific discovery. Specifically, I develop large-scale multi-modal diffusion language models to tackle protein modeling. My earlier work also explored foundation research areas, including [self-supervised learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Hsieh_Self-Supervised_Pyramid_Representation_Learning_for_Multi-Label_Visual_Analysis_and_Beyond_WACV_2023_paper.pdf), [amodal object tracking](https://tao-amodal.github.io), [federated learning](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/Publications/Conference/(2021)%20FL-HDC_Hyperdimensional_Computing_Design_for_the_Application_of_Federated_Learning.pdf), and vision language models. 


I was advised by Prof. [Deva Ramanan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/) during my master of science in computer vision at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I received my B.S. from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). I had the pleasure to work with Prof. [Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html) with Prof. [An-Yeu (Andy) Wu](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/).
