I’m a Senior Research Scientist at ByteDance Seed, based in San Jose. My research spans the fields of machine learning, computer vision, and AI for scientific discovery, with a core focus on developing **large-scale generative foundation models**. I specialize in leveraging diffusion and language models to advance a wide range of applications, from biomolecular modeling to video generation.

At ByteDance Seed, I co-lead the development of generative biomolecular foundation models, including the [DPLM](https://bytedance.github.io/dplm/) and [PAR](https://par-protein.github.io) series. My work covers the full model lifecycle, including large-scale **pre-training** and **mid-training** strategies that unify protein sequences with 3D structural data. I also worked on video generation, where I built 3D-consistent Diffusion Transformers to improve temporal and spatial coherence in video synthesis.

My earlier research explored foundational areas of representation learning and perception. This includes developing [self-supervised pyramid learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10030415) for visual analysis, advancing [amodal object tracking](https://tao-amodal.github.io) through the TAO-Amodal benchmark, and investigating vision-language models. I also worked on distributed ML systems, having published work on [federated learning](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/Publications/Conference/(2021)%20FL-HDC_Hyperdimensional_Computing_Design_for_the_Application_of_Federated_Learning.pdf) and communication-efficient [split learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9943507).



I earned my Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV) from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Deva Ramanan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/). I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), where I had the pleasure of working with Prof. [Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html) and Prof. [An-Yeu (Andy) Wu](http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/).
